a = int(input())

original = a 
reversed1 = 0 


while a > 0:
    digit = a % 10 
    reversed1 = reversed1 * 10 + digit 
    print(reversed1)
    a = a//10 
if original == reversed1:
    print(original)

time complexity is O(log n) because at every iteration the number is divisibel by 10 
space complexity is O(1)
