keep remeber one thing the leader is always checked from the right to left not from left to right 
a =[16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]

n = len(a)
right = a[-1]
save = [right]


for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    if a[i] > right:
        right = a[i]
        save.append(right)
save.reverse()
print(save)

Time complexity is :O(n) 
space comeplexity is :O(n)
