The Question is to move all the zeroes to beginning and ones to ending




a = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0] 

left = 0 
right = len(a) - 1 

while left < right:
    if a[left] == 0:
        left += 1 
    elif a[right] == 1:
        right -=1 
    elif a[left] == 1 and a[right] == 0:
        a[left],a[right] = a[right],a[left]
print(a)


time complexity :O(n) 
space complexity O(1)
