the code motive is to find the number which is not repeating in the array so if we see 5 repeated 2 times and 7 repeated 2 times but 6 only one time so 6 shoulf be the output 




from collections import defaultdict


a = [5,6,7,5,7]


h1 = defaultdict(int)

for i in a:
    h1[i] = h1[i] + 1
    
for i in a:
    if h1[i] <= 1:
        print(i)


defaultdict will count the value like {5:2,6:1,7:2} 


this will be done but default dict 

Time complexity is O(n) 
space Complextiy is O(n)



there is still we can do it easily
