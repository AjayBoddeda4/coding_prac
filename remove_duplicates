method1:
--------

a = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,9,9,9,9]

distinct = []

for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] not in distinct:
        distinct.append(a[i])
print(distinct) 


time complexity :O(n) 
space complexity :O(n) 



2nd approach:
------------

count = 1


for i in range(1,len(a)):
     if a[i-1] != a[i]:
          a[count] = a[i] 
          count += 1  
return count 

time complexity is :O(n)
space complexity is :O(1)
