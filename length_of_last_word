Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6. 



solution:
a = input().strip(" ")
save= ""

for i in range(len(a)-1,-1,-1):
    if a[i] == " ":
        break 
    else:
        save += a[i]
print(len(save[::-1]))


time complexity is :O(n) 
space compexity is :O(1) 

this can also be done using : len(input().rsplit().split()[-1]) 

print(len(input().rstrip().split()[-1]))
