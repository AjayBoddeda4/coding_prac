The theory of the Linked list 


now let think of a chain which is hanging with elements 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 

now i wants to reverse these elements 


as we know the linked list holds the node and address of the next node 


so now just think out of the box if there is a chain hanging and we are holding it with onehand if we disconnect the 1st link except 1st link all the links will fall down 


so what we do we connect the 2nd link to some link before we disconnect to the link 1 now 

lets think i wants to reverse the list 


assume the prev = none means the link before 1 there is nothing but assume 

and 1 is the current link now if i disconnect the 1st and 2nd link directly then 2nd link wont have head

so create a variable and store the 2nd link in that now 

connect the 1st link to the prev 


like 

prev = none 
curr = head 


now connect 2nd to some variable 

temp_next = curr.next 

now disconnect 1st link :
 curr.next = prev 

now make the prev = curr 

and curr = temp_next 

thats'it
