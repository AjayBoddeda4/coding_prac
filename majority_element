 In the leetcode majority element i have solved the problem using defaultdict 


from collections import defaultdict

a = [3,3,4]
leng = len(a)/2

h1 = defaultdict(int)

for i in a:
    h1[i] = h1[i] +1 
print(h1)
for i in a:
    if h1[i] >= leng:
        output = i 
print(output)

 The Answer is Accepted and with Time complexity O(n) but my theory is lagging the space Complexity it should be O(1) but it is now O(n)
