a = [1,3,4,6,8,2,9,10,7]

a.sort()

for i in range(len(a) - 1):
    if (a[i + 1] != a[i] + 1):
        print(a[i] + 1)
        
       

time complexity is O(n log n) because of sorting like O(n log n) + O(n) ~ O(n log n) 
Space Complexity is O(1) 



NOW:


a = [1,3,4,6,8,2,9,10,7]

sum1 = 0
leng = len(a) 

sum = 10*(10 + 1)/2

for i in range(len(a)):
    sum1 += a[i]
total = sum - sum1 
print(int(total))


Time Complexity is O(n) 
space Complexity is O(1)
