the code motive is to find the number which is not repeating in the array so if we see 5 repeated 2 times and 7 repeated 2 times but 6 only one time so 6 shoulf be the output 




from collections import defaultdict


a = [5,6,7,5,7]


h1 = defaultdict(int)

for i in a:
    h1[i] = h1[i] + 1
    
for i in a:
    if h1[i] <= 1:
        print(i)


defaultdict will count the value like {5:2,6:1,7:2} 


this will be done but default dict 

Time complexity is O(n) 
space Complextiy is O(n)




there is still we can do it easily


a = [5,6,7,5,7]
result = 0

for i in range(len(a)):
    result = result ^ a[i]
print(result)
    
    
    
here we done using XOR operation we know how Xor works 1 xor 1 = 0 
lets see how    

8 4 2 1 -->  rule

lets see 5 xor 6 

binary for 5: 0 1 0 1
binary for 6: 0 1 1 0
--------------------- 
now xor both:0 0 1 1  so now if we add the Xor values 2 + 1 = 3 so the output of 5 XOR 6 = 3
