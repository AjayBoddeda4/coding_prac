a = [1000,1001,1009,1006,1008,1007,1005,1004,1003,1002,1010]

leng = len(a) 
new = [0] * leng

for i in range(len(a)):
    sub = a[i] - 1000
    new[sub] = 1 

result = []

for i in range(len(new)):
    if(new[i] == 1):
        result.append(i + 1000)
print(result)
    

this is th perfect example of bin-sorting with the time complexity o(m + n) we sorted the array using bin sorting but the space complexity is increase to O(n)
