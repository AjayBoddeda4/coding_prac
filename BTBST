a = [5,8,9,4,3,10]

min_num = a[0]
max_profit = 0 

for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] < min_num:
        min_num = a[i]
    profit = a[i] - min_num 
    if profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = profit 
print(max_profit)



Time Complexity is O(n) 
space Complexitry is O(1) 


Theory:
a = [5,8,9,4,3,10]


min_num = a[0] 
max_profit = 0 
profit = 0 

min_num = 5 
if the min_num is less the the 5 then make then update the min_num 

take profit = a[i] - min_num means  8 - 5 = 3 
then profit = 3
max_profit also = 3 

min_num no change 
profit = a[i] - min_num = 9 - 5 = 4 
max_profit = 4

then min_num = 4 update 
profit = no change 
max_profit = no change 


3

min_num = 3 
profit = no change 
max_profit = no change 


10 

min_num = 3 
pofit = 10 - 3 = 7 
max_profit = 7
